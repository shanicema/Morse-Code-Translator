# Morse-Code-Translator

This project involved the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript where I built a morse code translater interface and program that auto-detects morse code & english text and translates them accordingly.

The project also involved creating unit tests and organising the project's code into meaningful modules to split the code between data, logic and dom functions.
