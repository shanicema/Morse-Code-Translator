# Morse-Code-Translator

Outline
This task will require you to create a web page Morse Code translator. The focus of this project will be putting your code into modules and creating unit tests The User Interface will have to look good but should remain simple (additional features, ie. sounds, lights, etc, should only be added once the MVP has been completed.)

MVP
Create a user interface that allows the user to either input some English text or some Morse Code

Create JS functions that would allow the user to:

translate their English text into Morse Code
Morse Code into English text
Make sure to handle spaces properly (ie. there is 1 space between English words, but one space between Morse Code characters)

Bonus: Handle other characters as well

Bonus: Detect if a piece of text is english or morse and translate accordingly

Split your code between data, logic functions and dom functions

Develop unit tests for all of your logic functions

Explore and discover edge cases in your code to further develop your tests
